This repository is where you should submit your ***code*** for the class Kaggle competition, if you choose that option for your term assignment.

# Task

# Notes
- You should approach this task **fairly** and with the mindset that you would use to approach a real-world problem. Your goal is to handle the nuances of this data well, while also not over-fitting. Designing a tool that gets a perfect score on training data, while performing poorly on novel data, is not something that would make an employer want to hire you.
- You are not obligated to use Python.
- You may delete or alter any files in this repository.
- You are free to add dependencies. (...but if I can't run it, I may not be able to offer much helpful feedback.)
  - Ensure that your code can be installed/used on another machine running Linux or MacOS (consider containerizing your project with Docker or an equivalent technology).
